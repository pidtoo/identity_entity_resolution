## HSPI (HealthShare Patient Index)
Machine Learning makes sense for the matches, but powerful rules engines/AI can inspect our enumerated pairs and provide more interrogation on to whether or not the two are a match that qualifies for Linking.

Powerful Linkage Definitions, that apply sophisticated rules to a pair of records and provide extended `link` criteria about the two records.

Implemented soley as an inference endpoint with customizable linkage definitions.

Thank you ["Dmitry Zasypkin"](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dmitry-zasypkin-dubai) for the push!!!
