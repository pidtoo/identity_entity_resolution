Machine Learning makes sense for the matches, but powerful rules engines/AI can inspect our enumerated pairs and provide more interrogation on to whether or not the two are a match that qualifies for Linking.

Here is a simple flow chart:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
```

## HSPI

Powerful Linkage Definitions, that apply sophisticated rules to a pair of records and provide extended `link` criteria about the two records.

Implemented soley as an inference endpoint with customizable linkage definitions.
