<span style="font-size:38px">
A recent survey by Black Book has quantified just how bad duplicate records can be. The survey found that an average hospital is spending an extra <mark>1.5 million USD</mark> an year due to duplicate and fragmented patient records. <mark>1.5 million USD</mark>! Lack of a master patient index is clearly a very costly affair.  The survey also found that with hospitals with more than 150 beds and hundreds of thousands of records, it took approximately 5 months for data cleaning with data validation and normalization. <mark>5 months</mark> of data cleaning equals <mark>625,000 USD</mark> duplicate data spend besides the software and implementation costs <mark>(1.5*5/12)</mark>.

Note:
My point here isnt to suggest those things can be replaced, but rather if the Health System
has to spend that kind of cash, why dont you?

Note:
Out of these two conditions, which one is worse ?
In the age of PHR's, patients can be exposed to this type of error.
