- create a markdown file for each section/chapter/ ...
  - you can choose this freely (also all slides in one file is possible)
  - new files are needed for references, i.e. jumping to different sections

Masting the "Other" Entities and How they are Related.

  ```markdown
  ## Slide 1

  Text on slide 1

  -&nbsp;-&nbsp;-

  ## Slide 2

  - List on slide 2
  ```

  - note that you need to remove the space between the `-` to make it work

- the best way is to check these [slides on Github]({{site.githuburl}}/tree/gh-pages/slides/getting_started/_posts)
