## Purpose

If you are going to Innovate on Health Data or Build a Solution using FHIR®, you sooner or later will come to a realization on how important <mark>Identity Resolution</mark> and <mark>Entity Resolution</mark> apply to the Health Data Workload.
<br/>
Thing is though, its _expensive_:

- Computationally
- Resource Intensive
- Time Consuming
<br/>
...and its easy to dismiss and kick the can down the road to get started on your venture.
<br/>
