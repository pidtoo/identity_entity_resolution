## Purpose

If you are going to Innovate on Health Data or Build a Solution using FHIR®, you sooner or later will come to a realization on how important <mark>Identity Resolution</mark> and <mark>Entity Resolution</mark> apply to the Health Data Workload.

Thing is though, its _expensive_ in traditional practices:

- Computationally
- Resource Intensive
- Time Consuming

Note:
The "Post 50" kind of expensive.
